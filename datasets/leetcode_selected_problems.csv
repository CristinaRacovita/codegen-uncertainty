Relative Ranks,"You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the `ith` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the `1st` place athlete has the highest score, the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:
The `1st` place athlete's rank is `""Gold Medal""`.

The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `""Silver Medal""`.

The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `""Bronze Medal""`.

For the `4th` place to the `nth` place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `xth` place athlete's rank is `""x""`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the rank of the `ith` athlete.


Example 1:
Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]

Truncate Sentence,"A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

For example, `""Hello World""`, `""HELLO""`, and `""hello world hello world""` are all sentences.

You are given a sentence `s`​​​​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​​. You want to truncate `s`​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first `k`​​​​​​ words. Return `s`​​​​​​ after truncating it.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""Hello how are you Contestant"", k = 4
Output: ""Hello how are you""
Explanation:
The words in s are [""Hello"", ""how"" ""are"", ""you"", ""Contestant""].

The first 4 words are [""Hello"", ""how"", ""are"", ""you""].

Hence, you should return ""Hello how are you"".


Example 2:
Input: s = ""What is the solution to this problem"", k = 4

Perform String Shifts,"You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix `shift`, where `shift[i] = [direction, amount]`:
`direction` can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift). 
`amount` is the amount by which string `s` is to be shifted.

A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.

Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""abc"", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]

Put Boxes Into the Warehouse II,"You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
Boxes cannot be stacked.

You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.

Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from either side (left or right)
If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]

Example 2:
Input: boxes = [3,5,5,2], warehouse = [2,1,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
It's not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the warehouse since there's only 1 room of height >= 5.

Other valid solutions are to put the green box in room 2 or to put the orange box first in room 2 before putting the green and red boxes.

Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable,"Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of `n` nodes and 3 types of edges:
Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.

Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.

Type 3: Can by traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge of type `typei` between nodes `ui` and `vi`, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.

Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return `-1` if it's impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by Alice and Bob.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.


Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.

Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence,"You are given an array `target` that consists of distinct integers and another integer array `arr` that can have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in `arr`. For example, if `arr = [1,4,1,2]`, you can add `3` in the middle and make it `[1,4,3,1,2]`. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`.

A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,2,3,7,2,1,4]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.


Example 1:
Input: target = [5,1,3], `arr` = [9,4,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes `arr` = [5,9,4,1,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of `arr`.


Example 2:
Input: target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], `arr` = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]

Cherry Pickup II,"Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries. Each cell in `grid` represents the number of cherries that you can collect.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you, Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0,0) , and Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols-1) of the grid.

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots  by following the rules below:
From a cell (i,j), robots can move to cell (i+1, j-1) , (i+1, j) or (i+1, j+1).

When any robot is passing through a cell, It picks it up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell (0).

When both robots stay on the same cell, only one of them takes the cherries.

Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.

Both robots should reach the bottom row in the `grid`.
